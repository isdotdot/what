The heat index, also known as the apparent temperature, is a measure of how hot it feels outside when temperature and humidity are combined. It's a way to understand the impact of both factors on our body's ability to cool itself.

## Why do we need the heat index?

When temperatures rise, our bodies try to cool down through sweating. However, if the air is already humid, sweat evaporates more slowly, making us feel hotter than the actual temperature would suggest. The heat index helps us understand this combined effect and provides a more accurate picture of how hot it really feels.

## How is the heat index calculated?

The National Weather Service (NWS) uses a formula to calculate the heat index based on air temperature and relative humidity. This calculation takes into account both factors, using a complex algorithm that involves temperature and dew point to arrive at an apparent temperature value.

### Understanding the heat index categories

The NWS categorizes heat indexes as follows:

* **Low risk**: 91°F - 103°F (33°C - 39°C) - No special precautions needed.
* **Moderate risk**: 104°F - 115°F (40°C - 46°C) - Stay in the shade, avoid strenuous activities during peak sun hours.
* **High risk**: 116°F - 130°F (47°C - 54°C) - Avoid strenuous activities, drink plenty of water.
* **Critical risk**: Above 130°F (54°C) - Avoid all outdoor activities.

## What's the difference between heat index and temperature?

The main difference is that the heat index takes into account both air temperature and relative humidity. For example:

* If it's 95°F (35°C) with low humidity, you'll feel relatively comfortable.
* But if it's 95°F (35°C) with high humidity, you may feel as hot as someone experiencing a temperature of around 105°F (40°C).

### When is the heat index most relevant?

The heat index is particularly important during periods of prolonged heat and humidity. These can be caused by various factors such as:

* Summer weather
* Heatwaves
* Thunderstorms
* Warm winter days

## How to stay safe when the heat index is high

To protect yourself from excessive heat, follow these tips:

* Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
* Avoid strenuous activities during peak sun hours (10am - 4pm).
* Wear light and loose clothing that allows for good airflow.
* Find shade or air-conditioned spaces when possible.

The heat index is a useful tool to help us understand how hot it really feels outside. By taking into account both temperature and humidity, we can better prepare ourselves for hot weather and stay safe during periods of excessive heat.
